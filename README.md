# Multimedia Authoring - Music Mixer S2023 

Welcome to our Music Mixer project! The main intent behind this collaboration was to research, experiment, design, and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Another relevant goal of this project was to create a dynamic audio experience by implementing drag and drop functionality to load audio clips, triggering animations, and playing a compiled audio track.

## History

> On a lighthearted note, we started off with the idea of Renaissance cats. Eventually, it developed into cats wearing classical costumes with the music complementing their respective attire. 

## Features

* `Drag and drop functionality`: Load audio clips by simply dragging and dropping them onto the application interface.
* `Dynamic audio experience`: Create a dynamic audio experience by manipulating and arranging the loaded audio clips.
* `Animation triggering`: Trigger animations based on user interactions or specific audio events.
* `Compiled audio track`: Play a compiled audio track that combines the loaded audio clips into a cohesive composition.
